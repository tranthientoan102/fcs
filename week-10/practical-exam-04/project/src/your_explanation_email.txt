Dear manager,

The problem (1), was due to function Insertion::sortStringByIndex was not implemented yet
I done implementing it;

The problem (2), was due to the staff list was not loaded at the moment you choose option 6,
I done fixing it by initializing it earlier;

The problem (3), was due to functions in SelectionSort is not implemented,
I done implementing function SelectionSort::sortIntByIndex first, other functions will be implemented later;

Kind regards, Thien Toan Tran - a1808080
